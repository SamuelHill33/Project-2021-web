Computer Science coding project year 1 - Card game; HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This coding project was created for my computer science class as a year 1 a level project.
This project acts as a tutorial / practice project if you like for the real NEA project that I will need to do during my second year.
The project includes 2 html files, 2 css files and 2 js files. 1 set for the login page and another set for the actual game.

Do with this as you like for it has little relevence to me in the long run though you probably dont want to be using this since this is my first real scripting attempt.
